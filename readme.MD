# Slices and Maps

## Description

Checking out some of the new packages in Go 1.21 - [slices](https://pkg.go.dev/slices) and [maps](https://pkg.go.dev/maps)

Simple set of wrapper methods applied to example types with basic unit tests against each to check out their functionality. These new packages seem rather useful for common slice and map operations that Go previously left to the coder to find their own solution on.

Just for my own interest and curiousity, rather than to add anything of particular value :)

## Notes

Includes a Makefile - run tests with `make test` or get coverage with `make test-coverage`
